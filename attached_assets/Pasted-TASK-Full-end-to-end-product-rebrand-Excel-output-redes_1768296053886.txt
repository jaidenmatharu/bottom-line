TASK: Full end-to-end product rebrand + Excel output redesign

PROJECT: [PASTE YOUR EXISTING REPLIT PROJECT LINK / NAME HERE]

NEW BRAND NAME (AUTHORITATIVE – NON-NEGOTIABLE):
Bottomline

BRAND INTENT:
Bottomline is a premium, institutional-grade financial modeling platform that automatically builds high-quality financial models. The brand must feel:
- Serious, confident, and professional
- On par with tools used by IB, PE, credit, and strategy teams
- “Sexy” in the finance sense: clean, sharp, restrained, confident
- Never gimmicky, playful, or consumer-toy-like

This is a COMPLETE rebrand. No legacy brand elements should remain anywhere.

────────────────────────────────────────
SCOPE OF WORK (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────

A. GLOBAL REBRAND (ZERO LEGACY ARTIFACTS)
- Replace the old product name everywhere:
  - App UI
  - Landing page
  - Auth pages
  - Dashboard
  - Terminal
  - Excel outputs
  - Metadata (page titles, OG tags)
  - Emails, notifications, PDFs, exports
  - README and internal documentation
- Remove all old logos, names, color references, and copy.
- Introduce Bottomline as the only brand reference across the system.

Acceptance:
- Grep search of repo returns ZERO references to the old brand.
- Bottomline appears consistently in UI, metadata, and outputs.

────────────────────────────────────────
B. BRAND SYSTEM (CREATE & APPLY)
────────────────────────────────────────

Create and enforce a unified brand system:

1. Typography:
   - Primary font: modern, professional (e.g. Inter / Source Sans / similar)
   - Numeric data must be highly legible and aligned for financial reading.
   - Consistent hierarchy across headers, tables, and terminal outputs.

2. Color system:
   - Primary: deep neutral (charcoal / near-black / dark slate)
   - Secondary: muted institutional accent (steel blue, graphite, muted emerald, or similar)
   - Avoid loud colors, gradients, or consumer SaaS palettes.
   - Define tokens: background, surface, text-primary, text-secondary, accent, danger, success.

3. UI principles:
   - Minimal, structured, whitespace-aware
   - Grid-based layouts
   - Financial-terminal clarity, but modern
   - Subtle motion only (hover, focus, transitions)

Deliverable:
- Brand tokens defined in a central file (CSS variables / theme config).
- Short BRAND.md explaining design logic and usage rules.

────────────────────────────────────────
C. WEBSITE & APP REDESIGN (BOTTOMLINE LOOK & FEEL)
────────────────────────────────────────

Landing Page:
- Headline that clearly states value:
  “Bottomline builds institutional-grade financial models automatically.”
- Clear CTA: “Generate a model”
- Feature blocks focused on outcomes, not buzzwords
- Professional tone; zero hype language
- Responsive across devices

App UI:
- Dashboard, terminal, repository, analysis pages updated to new brand system
- Tables and metrics should feel “Excel-clean” and analyst-friendly
- Replace any playful icons or illustrations with restrained iconography

Acceptance:
- Desktop + mobile screenshots included
- Visual consistency across landing → app → outputs

────────────────────────────────────────
D. EXCEL MODEL OUTPUT REDESIGN (CRITICAL)
────────────────────────────────────────

Excel output is a CORE PRODUCT SURFACE.
Treat it like something that could be sent directly to:
- Investment committees
- Banks
- IC decks
- Board materials

Requirements:

1. Sheet structure:
   - Clear cover / summary sheet branded “Bottomline”
   - Logical separation: Assumptions, Financials, Valuation, Sensitivities
   - Consistent sheet naming conventions

2. Formatting:
   - Professional financial formatting:
     - Right-aligned numbers
     - Consistent decimal places
     - Thousands separators
     - Negative numbers clearly styled
   - Clean column spacing and row grouping
   - Freeze headers where appropriate

3. Styling:
   - Subtle borders, no heavy gridlines
   - Clear section headers
   - Muted accent color for totals and key outputs
   - No Excel default blue styles

4. Usability:
   - Assumptions clearly editable
   - Calculations protected where appropriate
   - Key outputs easy to find and interpret
   - Sensitivity tables readable at a glance

5. Branding:
   - Footer or header: “Generated by Bottomline”
   - Timestamp and model version
   - No watermark spam

Acceptance:
- Provide at least ONE sample Excel file generated by the system
- File should look IC-ready without manual cleanup
- Include before/after screenshots in PR

────────────────────────────────────────
E. COPY & LANGUAGE REWRITE
────────────────────────────────────────

- Rewrite all product copy to match Bottomline’s tone:
  - Confident
  - Precise
  - Plain English
  - No buzzwords or hype
- Replace “AI-sounding” phrases with outcome-driven language:
  BAD: “AI-powered next-gen insights”
  GOOD: “Automatically built, auditable financial models”

Acceptance:
- No marketing fluff
- Copy reads like it was written for professionals

────────────────────────────────────────
F. QUALITY & DELIVERY
────────────────────────────────────────

- Do NOT change core business logic unless required for output quality
- Keep commits clean and logically separated
- Update README with:
  - New brand name
  - Product description
  - Screenshots
- Add a short “Rebrand Summary” section in the PR:
  - What changed
  - Files touched
  - Screenshots
  - Sample Excel output

────────────────────────────────────────
SUCCESS CRITERIA (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
────────────────────────────────────────

✔ The product feels like a serious financial tool  
✔ Excel outputs are impressive, clean, and professional  
✔ No trace of the old brand remains  
✔ The brand is consistent across web, app, and exports  
✔ A finance professional would trust the outputs without redesigning them  

If something is ambiguous, default to:
“Would this be acceptable in an investment committee deck?”
