TASK: Full feature and bug upgrade for my existing Replit project
PROJECT: [PASTE your Replit project link or name here: PROJECT_LINK]
CONTEXT:
You are working on an existing web app (fullstack). I don't want major architectural rewrites unless absolutely necessary — prefer incremental, well-tested improvements. Detect the tech stack automatically (e.g., Next.js/React + Node/Express, or React + Firebase, or Django, etc.) and adapt the implementation to the stack. If you must make a stack change, propose it in the PR description and justify why.

GOALS (high level):
1. Landing page upgrade (design, SEO, responsiveness, conversion).
2. Login / Sign-up upgrade (security, UX, OAuth, forgot password, email verification).
3. Fix terminal stats bug — ensure stats update when models are added/deleted.
4. Curate main terminal UI by user onboarding profile (personalized experience).
5. Core system build-out: Dashboard, Repository, Analysis, Intel, System Config, Security Protocols, User Page.
6. Add more valuation methods/inputs & increase usability and features.
7. Tests, docs, deployment readiness, and clear PR with screenshots and run instructions.

DETAILED TASKS & ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:

A. Project discovery & initial setup
- Detect and report stack (frameworks, DB, auth provider). If any dependency is missing, add to README and include install steps.
- Create a working branch named: BRANCH_NAME (e.g., feature/upgrade-jan2026).
- Provide a short tech summary at top of PR describing detected stack and key implementation choices.

B. Landing page upgrade
- Tasks:
  - Modernize layout and copy to clearly explain product value, pricing or CTA, and onboarding path.
  - Ensure responsive design across common breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop).
  - Add social proof / customer logos / feature highlights / clear CTA(s).
  - Improve SEO (appropriate title, meta description, OG tags), include structured data where relevant.
  - Ensure accessibility basics: semantic HTML, keyboard nav, color contrast.
- Acceptance:
  - Visual screenshots for desktop and mobile included in PR.
  - Lighthouse score: show improvements (report attached); not required to hit a specific number but must be demonstrably improved vs prior.
  - CTAs lead to the actual signup flow and are instrumented for click tracking.

C. Login & Sign-up upgrade
- Tasks:
  - Replace/upgrade auth flows to include:
    - Email + password with secure hashing.
    - Email verification on signup.
    - Forgot password / reset link flow.
    - Optional: OAuth sign-in options (Google and GitHub) if current stack supports it.
    - Form validation (client & server) with helpful error messages.
  - Improve UX: progressive onboarding hints, success toasts, disable buttons during requests.
  - Secure session handling (HttpOnly cookies or secure tokens), CSRF protection for forms, rate limits on auth endpoints.
- Acceptance:
  - End-to-end sign-up, verification, login, logout, and reset flows work in local and staging.
  - Automated tests added for key auth endpoints (unit/integration).
  - Documentation in README for env vars required (SMTP / OAuth credentials).

D. Terminal bug + real-time stats
- Problem: "Main terminal does not update the stats; it's static when deleting or adding a model."
- Tasks:
  - Investigate and fix root cause — whether frontend state not refreshing, missing socket/message, or backend not emitting events.
  - Implement real-time updates (WebSockets / SSE / polling fallback) for terminal stats when models are added/deleted/modified.
  - Ensure optimistic UI where appropriate and graceful error handling.
- Acceptance:
  - Adding or deleting a model updates terminal stats in <2s in local test via real-time event or reliable polling.
  - Add unit/integration tests that simulate add/delete model and assert updated API/state behavior.
  - Provide debugging notes in PR explaining root cause and fix.

E. Curated main terminal by onboarding profile
- Tasks:
  - Use existing onboarding metadata (or create a minimal profile schema) to present a curated terminal:
    - Show relevant metrics, recommended models, and short contextual help based on onboarding choices.
    - If user has no profile, show a guided default with a "complete onboarding" CTA.
  - Implement small personalization API or use existing user object.
- Acceptance:
  - For at least two sample user profiles (e.g., "Beginner" and "Advanced"), include screenshots showing different terminal states.
  - Provide unit tests or storybook stories (if applicable) illustrating personalization.

F. Core system build-out (each item should be an independent module/route/SPA page)
- Dashboard:
  - Overview, key metrics, recent activity, quick actions.
  - Configurable widgets (at minimum: models count, recent runs, queued jobs).
- Repository:
  - CRUD for models/assets; robust search and filtering; version history or at least last-modified info.
- Analysis:
  - Interface to run an analysis job on a model, view results, and persist results.
- Intel:
  - A read-only feed or card view for insights, alerts, or system messages.
- System Config:
  - Admin-only settings page to manage site-level configs and feature flags.
- Security Protocol:
  - Audit logs for sensitive actions (login attempts, model deletes), role-based access control enforcement (Admin vs User).
- User Page:
  - Profile management, API keys (create/revoke), billing placeholder if present.
- Acceptance:
  - Each module has routes, UI, and basic backend endpoints implemented.
  - RBAC implemented and enforced.
  - Basic unit tests and at least one e2e test for one or two modules.

G. More valuation methods & inputs
- Tasks:
  - Add at least 3 additional valuation methodologies or additional input fields to existing valuation tools (e.g., DCF with variable growth rates, comparable multiples, liquidation value, sensitivity scenarios).
  - Make inputs dynamic and allow saving presets.
  - Improve UI for entering assumptions and show summarized sensitivity tables or charts.
- Acceptance:
  - New methods appear in Analysis UI and can be run locally.
  - Results are saved and retrievable.
  - Provide example test dataset and run showing outputs.

H. Usability & product improvements
- Tasks:
  - Improve form UX, inline help tooltips, and microcopy.
  - Add client-side input validation and server-side verification.
  - Ensure consistent styling (follow existing design system or add a lightweight global CSS/Tailwind config).
- Acceptance:
  - Documented style decisions and updated global stylesheet or token file.
  - Run through a checklist of common flows and ensure no regressions.

I. Tests, CI, and deployment readiness
- Tasks:
  - Add/extend unit tests for backend and frontend.
  - Add a simple integration test for critical flows (auth, add/delete model, run analysis).
  - Update or add CI config (e.g., GitHub Actions) that runs tests on PRs (if relevant to repo).
  - Provide clear run instructions for local dev and staging deploy steps.
- Acceptance:
  - Tests pass locally and on CI.
  - README updated with environment variables, local setup, and how to run tests.

J. Security, privacy, and performance
- Tasks:
  - Ensure no secrets are committed.
  - Verify password storage and session handling are secure.
  - Scan for vulnerable dependencies (report included).
- Acceptance:
  - Short security checklist added to PR.
  - No secrets in commits and no high-severity dependency alerts unresolved.

DELIVERABLES (what I want in the PR)
1. Branch: BRANCH_NAME.
2. One or multiple pull requests with descriptive titles and small commits per logical change.
3. PR description must include:
   - Stack summary and files touched.
   - Root cause analysis for the terminal stats bug and exact code changes.
   - Screenshots (desktop + mobile) for UI changes.
   - How to test locally (commands, env vars), and example test cases.
4. Changelog or migration script for DB changes (if any).
5. Unit and integration test outputs or CI link.
6. Updated README with setup instructions and a short developer guide for the new modules.
7. Export or JSON of sample user profiles and sample dataset used for valuation examples.

DEVELOPER RULES & QUALITY STANDARDS
- Keep changes modular and well-documented.
- Write clear, atomic commits and add meaningful commit messages.
- Add code comments where behavior might be surprising.
- No breaking changes to existing APIs unless necessary — if unavoidable, document migration steps.
- Use environment variables for secrets; update README with examples and names.
- Ensure accessibility basics and responsive UI.
- If you introduce new libraries, add justification in PR and keep dependencies minimal.

QA CHECKLIST (must be completed before marking ready)
- [ ] All auth flows tested (sign up, verify, login, logout, reset).
- [ ] Add/Delete model updates terminal stats in real-time (screenshots/video).
- [ ] Personalized terminal displays according to onboarding profiles (2 examples).
- [ ] Landing page passes mobile + desktop screenshot review and basic Lighthouse check.
- [ ] Core modules accessible, RBAC enforced for admin routes.
- [ ] Tests pass and CI configured.
- [ ] README and env var list updated.
- [ ] No secrets in repo.

COMMUNICATION & HANDOFF
- On PR creation, post a short summary message here with PR link, list of important files changed, and the testing steps you ran.
- Provide a short "how to rollback" note if something goes wrong on staging.

If anything is unclear about the current code or stack, prefer to open a short RFC in the repo (file: RFC_UPGRADE.md) describing the proposed approach and why, instead of making large breaking changes without review. But do not block on trivial clarifications — make a best-practice implementation for common stacks.
