TASK: Implement Executive-Level Business Insights Engine for Bottomline

PROJECT:
[PASTE YOUR REPLIT PROJECT LINK / NAME HERE]

FEATURE NAME:
Executive Insights

CORE OBJECTIVE:
Add a new capability to Bottomline that produces **high-level, executive-ready insights**
derived from the underlying financial models, assumptions, scenarios, sensitivities,
and portfolio data.

This is NOT analytics noise.
This is NOT verbose AI commentary.
This is NOT a data dump.

This feature must answer:
“What does this mean for the business, and what should leadership pay attention to?”

If an insight would not be useful to a CEO, IC member, or board, it does not belong.

────────────────────────────────────────
A. EXECUTIVE INSIGHTS – CONCEPT & PLACEMENT
────────────────────────────────────────

Create a dedicated **Executive Insights** surface within the app.

Placement:
- Top-level navigation item OR
- A prominent tab within Dashboard / Analysis

Purpose:
- Translate model outputs into strategic, business-level implications
- Highlight risks, drivers, and decision-relevant conclusions
- Abstract away technical modeling detail unless explicitly expanded

Tone:
- Clear
- Calm
- Confident
- Non-technical
- No hype, no jargon

────────────────────────────────────────
B. TYPES OF INSIGHTS TO GENERATE
────────────────────────────────────────

Insights must be generated from REAL underlying data and models.

1. Performance Summary
- High-level snapshot of:
  - Revenue trajectory
  - Margin profile
  - Cash generation
  - Leverage and liquidity
- Expressed in plain business language

Example (directional tone, not literal text):
“Revenue growth is primarily driven by pricing rather than volume, increasing margin sensitivity to demand softening.”

2. Key Value Drivers
- Identify and rank:
  - The 3–5 variables that most impact valuation or returns
- Derived from sensitivities and scenario analysis

Example:
“Exit multiple and EBITDA margin expansion account for over 60% of equity value variance.”

3. Risk Signals
- Highlight:
  - Downside scenarios
  - Covenant pressure
  - Cash shortfalls
  - Concentration risk
- Flag issues early and clearly

Example:
“Under conservative growth assumptions, free cash flow turns negative in Year 3.”

4. Scenario Comparison
- Summarize differences between:
  - Base
  - Upside
  - Downside
- Focus on implications, not mechanics

Example:
“The downside case compresses IRR by 8 points while still preserving capital, suggesting asymmetric risk is limited.”

5. Portfolio-Level Insights (if applicable)
- Cross-model observations:
  - Exposure concentration
  - Correlated risks
  - Return dispersion

Example:
“Portfolio returns are disproportionately driven by two assets with similar demand drivers.”

────────────────────────────────────────
C. INSIGHT STRUCTURE & FORMAT
────────────────────────────────────────

Each insight must follow a disciplined structure:

- Headline (1 sentence, bold, plain English)
- Supporting context (2–3 concise sentences)
- Optional expandable detail (for analysts)
- Confidence indicator (high / medium / low based on data stability)

Avoid:
- Long paragraphs
- Buzzwords
- Technical jargon unless expandable

Acceptance:
- Insights readable in under 30 seconds
- No scrolling walls of text

────────────────────────────────────────
D. INTERACTIVITY & CONTROL
────────────────────────────────────────

Users must be able to:
- Refresh insights when assumptions change
- Toggle insight depth (Executive vs Detailed)
- Filter by:
  - Risk
  - Value drivers
  - Liquidity
  - Growth
- Export insights:
  - As a one-page executive summary
  - As part of Excel or PDF outputs

────────────────────────────────────────
E. EXCEL & EXPORT INTEGRATION
────────────────────────────────────────

Include Executive Insights in exports.

Excel:
- Dedicated “Executive Summary” tab
- Clean, professional formatting
- Bottomline branding
- Clear headings and spacing

PDF (if applicable):
- IC-ready layout
- Plain English
- No charts unless they directly support the insight

Acceptance:
- Output can be sent directly to:
  - CEO
  - IC
  - Board
Without explanation or cleanup.

────────────────────────────────────────
F. DATA INTEGRITY & GOVERNANCE
────────────────────────────────────────

Rules:
- Insights must be traceable to underlying data
- No hallucinated numbers
- No generic statements
- If confidence is low, state it explicitly

Implement:
- Insight provenance (which model, scenario, assumptions)
- Timestamp
- Model version reference

────────────────────────────────────────
G. QUALITY BAR (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
────────────────────────────────────────

✔ Insights feel senior, not analytical  
✔ Language is business-first, not model-first  
✔ No filler or generic commentary  
✔ Directly supports decision-making  
✔ Feels credible in a boardroom  

Final validation question before marking complete:
“Would a CEO actually read this?”

If not, refine further.
