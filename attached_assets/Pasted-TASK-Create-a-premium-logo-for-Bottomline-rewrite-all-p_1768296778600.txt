PROJECT: [PASTE YOUR REPLIT PROJECT LINK / NAME HERE]

BRAND NAME:
Bottomline

BRAND POSITIONING:
Bottomline builds institutional-grade financial models automatically.
It should feel:
- Calm, confident, and authoritative
- Premium, not flashy
- Designed for professionals who care about clarity and outcomes
- Sexy in the finance sense: restraint, precision, confidence

Nothing should feel like consumer SaaS, fintech hype, or AI theater.

────────────────────────────────────────
A. LOGO DESIGN (PRIMARY VISUAL IDENTITY)
────────────────────────────────────────

Design a complete logo system for Bottomline.

1. Primary logo
- Typography-led wordmark (preferred)
- Optional subtle mark or abstraction
- No fintech clichés (charts, arrows, lightning bolts)
- Must work on both light and dark backgrounds
- Timeless and credible in a boardroom or IC deck

2. Secondary / compact logo
- Minimal monogram or icon treatment
- Suitable for favicon, mobile nav, Excel footers
- Must still feel serious and premium

3. Color usage
- Default: monochrome (black / white / charcoal)
- Accent color allowed but extremely restrained
- Logo must remain strong in pure black or white

Deliverables:
- SVG (primary)
- SVG (icon)
- PNG (light & dark)
- Favicon-compatible asset

Design test:
“If this appeared on a Lazard, Evercore, or Blackstone slide, would it feel appropriate?”

────────────────────────────────────────
B. COPY REWRITE (MANDATORY & COMPREHENSIVE)
────────────────────────────────────────

Rewrite ALL product copy to align with Bottomline’s tone.
This includes:
- Landing page
- Navigation labels
- Headlines & subheadlines
- Feature descriptions
- Auth pages (login, signup, onboarding)
- Dashboard & terminal labels
- Tooltips, helper text, empty states
- Generated outputs (Excel headers, summaries, footers)
- README and product description

Tone guidelines:
- Confident, not loud
- Precise, not verbose
- Plain English, no buzzwords
- Outcome-driven, not “AI-powered” hype

BANNED PHRASES (examples):
- “AI-powered”
- “Next-generation”
- “Revolutionary”
- “Unlock insights”
- “Magic / smart / supercharged”

PREFERRED LANGUAGE:
- “Automatically built financial models”
- “Clear, auditable assumptions”
- “Institutional-grade outputs”
- “Designed for real decisions”

Example direction:
BAD:
“AI-powered platform that unlocks powerful financial insights.”

GOOD:
“Bottomline builds clean, auditable financial models you can trust.”

Landing page copy must:
- Immediately explain what Bottomline does
- Communicate credibility
- Avoid marketing fluff
- Feel written for serious users

────────────────────────────────────────
C. LOGO + COPY IMPLEMENTATION
────────────────────────────────────────

Apply the logo and rewritten copy consistently across:

1. Website & App
- Header (top-left)
- Login & signup pages
- Dashboard
- Terminal
- Mobile navigation
- Footer (subtle)

2. Metadata & system surfaces
- Favicon
- Browser title
- OpenGraph images
- Emails and notifications (if present)

3. Generated Outputs
- Excel models:
  - Clean “Bottomline” branding in header or footer
  - Compact logo mark where space is limited
  - Professional, understated placement
- PDFs / reports (if applicable)

4. Documentation
- README header updated to Bottomline
- Product description rewritten in new tone
- Add short “Brand Voice & Copy” section

Acceptance:
- Logo and copy feel intentional, not decorative
- No inconsistent tone across surfaces
- Branding never interferes with usability

────────────────────────────────────────
D. BRAND & COPY GOVERNANCE
────────────────────────────────────────

Create a short BRAND.md (or LOGO_USAGE.md) that defines:
- Logo usage rules (primary vs icon)
- Clear space and sizing
- Approved color usage
- Copy tone rules (what to say, what to avoid)
- Examples of good vs bad copy

Keep this concise and practical.

────────────────────────────────────────
E. QUALITY BAR (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
────────────────────────────────────────

✔ Logo feels credible in institutional finance  
✔ Copy reads like it was written for professionals  
✔ No hype, no fluff, no startup clichés  
✔ Branding consistent across web, app, and outputs  
✔ Excel models and UI feel IC-ready without cleanup  

If anything feels trendy, playful, or over-designed:
Redesign it.

Default decision rule:
“Would a senior banker trust this at first glance?”
