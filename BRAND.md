# Bottomline Brand System

## Brand Overview

Bottomline builds institutional-grade financial models automatically. The brand must communicate:

- Calm, confident, and authoritative
- Premium, not flashy
- Designed for professionals who care about clarity and outcomes
- Restraint, precision, confidence

Nothing should feel like consumer SaaS, fintech hype, or AI theater.

**Design test**: "If this appeared on a Lazard, Evercore, or Blackstone slide, would it feel appropriate?"

## Quality Bar

Every design decision must pass:

1. Would a senior banker trust this at first glance?
2. Does this feel appropriate in an IC deck?
3. Is the copy clear without being boring?
4. Is the branding present but not intrusive?

If anything feels trendy, playful, or over-designed — redesign it.
